Narrator (Jim Carrey): Hello there, traveler, if you’re seeking a stimulating adventure, then you’ve come to the right place. You see, I have this mask- it’s a very nice mask- so nice, that it would be a shame to not take this mask that I’m offering to you.


This mask is incomplete, however, but unlock its secrets and you, my friend, get to be the first person to get a reward of… priceless value.


Bookkeeper (Annoyed Rat): You- YOU! What are you doing here? This is my house you foul beast, get out of my house! Get out! 


Oh you’re here to solve my puzzle hey? Never in a million years could someone like you solve my puzzle. This has remained unsolved for generations! But if you’d like to try, go ahead, waste your time.


Ohhh… you actually did it! I never doubted you at all, adventurer, I always knew you could do it!


Zaddy (Penguin): Yo what’s up dude! The name’s Zaddy but you can call me Zad. I see you’re here to solve my puzzle, man, that’s cool, that’s cool. This piece has a long history of coolness, so if you can solve it, you can be cool too, man!


Let’s go man, you did it! Welcome to the cool club!


Last Puzzlekeeper (Personality disorder): (John Wayne) Is that you traveler, is this me? (Gollum) You seek to solve the final puzzle of GenoMac? Ahhh yesss, ambitious you are. I wish you (Kermit) good luck traveler, no one has ever made it this far, (Low voice/Batman) until you. 


(Bane) Impressive, traveler. You have completed the final puzzle of the mask GenoMac. Your reward awaits you!


Narrator: Congratulations traveler, you have successfully solved… all the puzzles. This is a feat of… great accomplishment, one that no one has ever done before. You see, now that the mask is complete, (deep normal voice) you have freed me and put me back together. I was very puzzled about who I was, but thanks to you I know who I am now. Your reward is my gratitude, thank you!
